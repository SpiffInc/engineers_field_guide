# Working Together

We like working together at Spiff.
We go out of our way to welcome to new team members, help each other get up to speed on projects, pair on fixing problems with our local setup and share ideas for the future.

Within any given pod our primary goal is to bring the skills and thoughts of design, engineering, and product together.

## Humor and Sarcasm

We want to laugh and joke together in a way that is safe and comfortable for all our teammates.
When the individuals involved in a joke all feel included, it can relieve tension and increase team cohesion.
We do not make comments or jokes which imply that people are unwelcome at Spiff.

Sometimes we make mistakes and say something which is hurtful or exclusionary to our teammates or other groups of people.
When this happens, we own the mistake, apologize and make a concerted effort to prevent that mistake in the future.

If you see one of these mistakes happen, it's best to mention it in the moment so the whole team knows that it's not okay.
If you don't feel comfortable bringing it up in the moment, please reach out to someone shortly after.
This could be the person who made the comment, your pod lead, your manager, or anyone else on the team you feel comfortable discussing it with.

Large groups calls are an area where it's especially easy to make a mistake.
You might not be considering the entire audience, or be unaware of another recent conversation that relates to the topic at hand.
Please proceed at your own risk when making a joke in these situations.
