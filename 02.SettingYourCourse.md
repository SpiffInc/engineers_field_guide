# Setting Your Course

When you drive to work, you don't spend 30 mins perfectly aiming your car at precisely the location of the office.
You take a practical approach of pointing in roughly the right direction and making thousands of slight corrections along the way.
Your time at Spiff will similarly require lots of small adjustments.

You should try to set a few goals for yourself that you think you can accomplish in the next 3 months.
These goals should be focused on the long-term success of the people using our software.
Can you make it easier to setup a compensation plan for the first time?
Reduce the time it takes for a finance person to review commissions?
Can you help sales people better understand their commission plan?

> Sometimes the long-term success of our users is best impacted by improving our own processes, tooling or habits.
> You might choose to set goals around these things, but just remember that you need to be able to draw a clear line between the work you do and how it affects end-users.

Now you need some way to know if you are heading in roughly the right direction.
You need to pick a few metrics that can be objectively measured.
If your goal was to make it easier to setup a plan, what would you expect to see differently in a world where it was easier vs a world where it was harder?
Perhaps the support team is already tracking a metric around how many support requests they receive from users working on plans?
You could instrument the code to measure how long people spend setting up their first plan.
Conversion rate in the onboarding flow would probably be higher if the process were more intuitive, right?

Pick a few of these metrics, and start tracking them.
As you work with other people to make changes to the product, check back on those metrics to see if they are headed in the right direction.
Later when you have a one-on-one with the CTO, these metrics will be the most important indication of your performance at Spiff.
